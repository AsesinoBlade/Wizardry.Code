Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC025 - Fix Addlongs vs Experience Points
=========================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	10-Feb-2023.

Contributors:	E. Labelle. Information from DDG Ahab and Denis Molony. Solution from Thomas Ewers.

The issue:	The Addlongs procedure that adds two numbers has a bug where part of the first value is passed on to the second value because they have the same name thus having a addition/multiplication side effect. This causes the experience points of some monsters to be artificially high.

The fix:	 Updated the declaration of the procedure to have the second value as a constant.

Why this fix: 	To fix the Addlongs procedure bug. Also, this makes current monsters or future ones in another scenario to have a more predictable experience allocation.
