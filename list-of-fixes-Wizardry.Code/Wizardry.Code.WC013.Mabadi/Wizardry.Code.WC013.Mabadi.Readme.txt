Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC013 - Mabadi
==============================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	11-Jan-2023

Contributor:	E. Labelle

The Issue:	Monsters " IS HIT BY MABADI!" message is displayed although no monsters are left alive.

The fix:	Added code to skip that effect and message if the monster is dead. Also, removed an extra space at the beginning of " IS HIT...".

Why this fix:	To skip the Mabadi effect and message if the monster is dead.
