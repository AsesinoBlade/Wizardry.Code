Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC002 - Misspelling Dispel, Morgue and Group #
==============================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	26-Dec-2022

Contributor:	E. Labelle (Information source: D. Molony, E. Labelle)

The Issue:	Misspelling Dispel and Morgue. Also fixing spelling of "GROUP # ?" for consistency.

- While in the maze, you can cast the Kandi spell to find where a character is. If the character you are looking for is dead but has been brought back to the castle, you get the following message - "The soul of Werdna is.. in the mourge". Corrected "mourge" to "morgue".

- The word "Dispel" was misspelled "Dispell" throughout the game, they are corrected here:
Old Spelling		New Spelling
D)ISPELL		D)ISPEL
DISPELL WHICH GROUP# ?	DISPEL WHICH GROUP # ?
DISPELLS!		DISPELS!


The fix:	Edit the text.

Why this fix:	To correct misspelling and consistency in display.
