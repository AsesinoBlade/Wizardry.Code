Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC001 - Bishop Bug
==================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	19-Dec-2022

Contributor:	E. Labelle (Information source: R. Woodhead)

The Issue:	If your character is a Bishop, it can identify the true name of an item. These items are in its inventory slots 1 through 8. Pressing other keys besides 1 through 8 can have the following benefits:

-	9 : The Bishop gains 100 million experience points.
-	S : The character below the Bishop gains 100 million experience points.
-	J : The character below the Bishop gains 100 million gold pieces.


The fix:

This bug is due to a programming error. The code is similar to "IF (CH>="1") OR (CH<="8") THEN". The "OR" should have been a "AND".

Why this fix:

To prevent exploit and to prevent game corruption if other keys are pressed.
