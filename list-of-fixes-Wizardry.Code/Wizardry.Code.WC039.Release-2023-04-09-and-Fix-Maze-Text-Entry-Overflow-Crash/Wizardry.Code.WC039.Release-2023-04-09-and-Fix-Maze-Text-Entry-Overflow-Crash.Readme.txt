Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.



Release #:	WC039 - Release 09 Apr 2023 and Fix Maze Text Entry Overflow Crash
==================================================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	09-Apr-2023.

Contributors:	Eric Labelle. Bug reported by Reiska42.

The issue:	In the maze, when entering text for a spell name, trap name, time delay, or answer to a riddle, if you continue typing characters the text will overflow to next lines and eventually the game will crash.

The fix:	Restrict the lenght of the entry to the mininum necessary to prevent the game from crashing.
	
Why this fix: 	To prevent the game from crashing. But, did not make it so short as to prevent answering a fairly long riddle of up to 22 characters. One can still corrupt the screen by overtyping but at least the game will not crash anymore.
