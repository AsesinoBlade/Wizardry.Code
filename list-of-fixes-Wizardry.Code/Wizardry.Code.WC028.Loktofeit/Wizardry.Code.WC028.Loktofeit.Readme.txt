Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Enhancement #:	WC028 - Loktofeit
=================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	12-Feb-2023.

Contributors:	E. Labelle.

The issue:	The cast chance and penalty for using Loktofeit is such that it is never used.

The fix:	Updated the code so that the cast chance is the same as Wizardry 3 - Legacy of Llylgamyn which is (65 + Character Level)%.

Why this fix: 	To have the cast chance align with Legacy of Llylgamyn.

Source disk:	Wiz1B.dsk

File:		COMBAT4.TEXT

Procedure:	PROCEDURE SLOKTOFE;  (* P010818 *)
				
Code from:	
          IF (RANDOM MOD 100) >  2 * CHARACTR[ BATI].CHARLEV THEN
            BEGIN
              MVCURSOR( 1, 13);
              PRINTSTR( 'LOKTOFEIT FAILS!');
              EXIT( SLOKTOFE)
            END;            
Code to:
          IF (RANDOM MOD 100) >  65 + CHARACTR[ BATI].CHARLEV THEN
            BEGIN
              MVCURSOR( 1, 13);
              PRINTSTR( 'LOKTOFEIT FAILS!');
              EXIT( SLOKTOFE)
            END;

Final compiled file name:	WIZARDRY.CODE

Destination disks:		Any Wizardry Proving Grounds boot and scenario disks.
