Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC033 - Inventory Full Fix
==========================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	08-Mar-2023.

Contributors:	Eric Labelle.

The issue:	Before the fix, a random character was selected to receive a treasure item. If that character's inventory was full, then the item was lost. This meant you might not have gotten Werdna's amulet upon defeating him for example.

The fix:	Look at the entire party's inventory for space to receive an item. Display a message when the entire party's inventory is full.

Why this fix: 	To avoid having to continuously micro manage the party's inventory to ensure that there is enough space for treasure drops.
