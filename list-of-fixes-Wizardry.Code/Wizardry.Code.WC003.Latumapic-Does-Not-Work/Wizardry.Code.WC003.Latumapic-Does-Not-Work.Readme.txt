Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC003 - Latumapic does not work
===============================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	27-Dec-2022

Contributor:	E. Labelle (Information source: DDG Ahab)

The Issue:	Casting the Latumapic spell does not identify the monsters' true names, thus making this spell useless.

The fix:	Change the loop variable from LLBASE04 to GROUPI.

Why this fix:	To make the Latumapic spell work on on all groups of monsters.
