Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Enhancement #:	WC030 - Ninja Enhancements
==========================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	27-Feb-2023.

Contributors:	Eric Labelle and DDG Ahab.

The issue:	Ninjas are not living up to their unarmed combat performance promise. Here is the Ninja definition in the Wizardry manual:

"NINJA - are inhuman fighting machines. They can use any weapons or
armor, but work best without any! When fighting without protection with
their bare hands, they can cause havoc and destruction, and may even kill
the strongest opponent with a single blow! Their great training gives them a
lower and lower ARMOR CLASS as they reach higher and higher levels of
ability. However, they get hit points as does a THIEF and gain no spells.
Finally, they must be EVIL"

Most of everything above concerning unarmed combat does not happen in-game. In 1981 you did not know that prior to playing the game. And if you succeeded (without cheating) in making a ninja, you found out that its unarmed performance was a total heart-breaking disappointment. The result is that essentially nobody played an unarmed ninja.

Also, to switch class to ninja you needed 17 in all attributes which is almost impossible to get before the end of the game.

The fix:	Made these code enhancements:

- The requirements to change class to ninja are now 15 in all attributes instead of 17. Must still be of evil alignment.
- Base bare hands damage increased from 2d4 to 2d8.
- Unarmed Armor Class improved from 1 point every 3 levels, to 1 point every level.
- Unarmed Combat Initiative Bonus of 1 point (10%) for every 3 levels. Gives the ninja more chances to strike the monsters first.

Note that the ninja has 1 extra attack per round compared to other fighter classes, this has not changed. Critical hit chance has not changed either.

Why this fix: 	Make it worthwhile to role-play an unarmed ninja.
