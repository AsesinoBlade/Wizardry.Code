Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC021 - Monsters Wrongly Casting Zilwan
=======================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	05-Feb-2023.

Contributors:	E. Labelle. DDG Ahab.

The issue:	Some monsters are casting the ZILWAN spell which does abolutely nothing to the player characters.

The fix:	Changed the monsters' casting of ZILWAN for MADALTO instead.

Why this fix:	Madalto was the only spell that made sense. Other high level spells like Makanito, Mamorlis, Lakanito, Masopic do nothing at all or nothing useful for the monsters.
