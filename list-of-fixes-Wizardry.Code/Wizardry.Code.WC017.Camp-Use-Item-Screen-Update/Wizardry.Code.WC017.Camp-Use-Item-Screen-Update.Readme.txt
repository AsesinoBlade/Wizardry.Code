Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.

The Issue:	When in Camp, if using an item and it decays (Ex: Dios Potion > Broken Item), the display still shows the undecayed item name.
