Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC015 - To Hit
==============================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	17-Jan-2023.

Contributor:	E. Labelle (Information source: DDG Ahab).

The Issue:	Monsters in the front row were harder to hit than monsters in the back row, which made no sense.

The fix:	The variable VICTIM is monster groups 1 to 4. Changed the code to: "+ ((3 * VICTIM) - 6);". Extra set of parentheses here to make sure nothing stupid happens and for clarity. This way, the chance to hit the first monster group does not change, i.e., -3 (-15%), a minus number here is good, but each subsequent monster groups are harder to hit by 3 (15%).

Why this fix:	To make the "To Hit" chance against the monsters work properly and logically.
