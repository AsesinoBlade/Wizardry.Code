Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Enhancement #:	WC023 - Surprise Round Enhancement
==================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	07-Feb-2023.

Contributors:	E. Labelle. Suggested by DDG Ahab.

The issue:	Getting your party wiped out on round one because you got surprised by spellcasters or breathers kills the fun factor in the game.

The fix:	Modified the code to disallow casting spells and using breath weapons during surprise rounds for both monsters and characters.

Why this fix:	 Wizardry 3 alleviated this by disallowing spells during surprise rounds. Here we are doing the same and also disallowed breath weapons as well. For example: This way your party does not get wiped out on a surprise breath attack round from the Dragon Zombies.
