Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC011 - Monster Affliction Dispel
=================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	07-Jan-2023

Contributor:	E. Labelle (Information source: DDG Ahab)

The Issue:	Dispel does not work on undead monsters with status afflictions. This would be a pretty rare occurrence though; Katino doesn't work on the undead, and casting Manifo when you can just dispel them is a bit crazy.

The fix:	Adjust code to have dispel work on monsters that have an affliction.

Why this fix:	To have dispel work on monsters that have an affliction.
