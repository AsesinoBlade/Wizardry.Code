Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC026 - Misspelling Bad Amount
==============================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	11-Feb-2023.

Contributors:	E. Labelle.

The issue:	When trading gold between two characters, and the amount entered is invalid you get a message. The contraction of a word in that message is slightly annoying and unnecessary.

The fix:	Changed the message from "Bad Amt" to "Bad Amount".

Why this fix: 	Clarity. To remove the distration caused by the contraction of a word.
