Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC005 - No Friends Fix
======================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	30-Dec-2022

Contributor:	E. Labelle (Information source: E. Labelle)

The Issue:	The monsters' friends/no friends attribute does not work at all. In a monster record, there is an attribute to resist befriending, meaning you cannot have a friendly encounter with them if set to on (or true). The issue was that even if that attribute was on, you could still have a friendly encounter with them.

The fix:	Added a a line of code to the FRIENDLY procedure to check if that monster's attribute is on for the first group of monsters, and if it is then exit the FRIENDLY procedure.

Why this fix:	To make the monster's resistance to befriending work.

Source Disk:	Wiz1B.dsk

File:		COMBAT.TEXT

Segment:	PROCEDURE FRIENDLY;  (* P010509 *)

Code From:
          BEGIN (* FRIENDLY *)
            GOODLEAV := FALSE;

Code To: Note that BATTLERC is the monster group where 1 means the first monster group, WEPVSTY3 is the monster resistance where 0 is No Friends, 1 is Fire, 2 is Cold, Etc.

          BEGIN (* FRIENDLY *)
            (* WC005 EXIT IF FIRST MONSTER GROUP RESISTS BEFRIENDING *)
            IF BATTLERC[ 1].B.WEPVSTY3[ 0] THEN
              EXIT (FRIENDLY);
          
            GOODLEAV := FALSE;

Final Compiled File Name:	WIZARDRY.CODE

Destination Disks:		Any Wizardry Proving Grounds boot and scenario disks.
