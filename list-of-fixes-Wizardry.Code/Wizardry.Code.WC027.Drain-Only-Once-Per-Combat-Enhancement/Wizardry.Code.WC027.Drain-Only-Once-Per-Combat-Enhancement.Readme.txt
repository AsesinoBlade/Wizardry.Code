Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Enhancement #:	WC027 - Drain Only Once Per Combat Enhancement
==============================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	11-Feb-2023.

Contributors:	E. Labelle.

The issue:	Monsters can drain your characters several times during combat. This is killing the fun factor in the game.

The fix:	Added code for the monsters to not being able to drain your characters if they have already been drained. This includes a character drained by Haman or Mahaman. Although, casting successively Haman or Mahaman will drain your characters each time.

Why this fix: 	The draining effects are now working the same way they are in Wizardry 3 - Legacy of Llylgamyn.
