Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Bug/Issue #:	WC022 - Treasure Tables Range Bug
=================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	06-Feb-2023.

Contributors:	E. Labelle, DDG Ahab, D. Molony.

The issue:	In short, the lower range of the treasure tables is off by two, and the upper range off by one.

The fix:	Adjust to code for the monsters' treasure to give the intended treasures.

Why this fix:	The monsters were not giving the intended range of treasures they were set to in the Wizardry database across all the treasure tables. The most blatant example: the monsters are not supposed to drop a Deadly Ring which is a one-time event in the game. The fix also takes care of a division by zero problem, i-e, x MOD 0.

File:		REWARDS.TEXT

Procedure:	PPROCEDURE ITEMREWD;  (* P010D1D *)
		
Code from:

               (REWARDM.REWDCALC.ITEM.MFACTOR * CHARIIII);

Code to:

            ITEMINDX := REWARDM.REWDCALC.ITEM.MININDX +
               (RANDOM MOD (REWARDM.REWDCALC.ITEM.RANGE + 1)) +
